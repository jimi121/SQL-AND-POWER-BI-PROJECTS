Our analysis relies on four primary datasets:

1. **Voter Registration Data**:
   - `Voter ID`: Unique identifier for each voter.
   - `Age`, `Gender`, `Voting History`: Age, gender, and history of voting.
   - `Registration Date`: Date of registration.

2. **Feedback and Complaints Data**:
   - `Feedback ID`: Unique identifier for feedback entries.
   - `Voter ID`, `Feedback Text`, `Timestamp`: Voter reference, feedback content, and timestamp.

3. **Security Incident Data**:
   - `Log ID`, `Event Type`, `User ID`, `Location`, `Timestamp`: Security event details.

4. **User Interaction Data**:
   - `Interaction ID`, `Voter ID`, `Page Views`, `Clicks`, `Device Used`, `Timestamp`: Data on user interactions.

##  üõ† Technology Stack

- **SQL (PostgreSQL):** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.

- **Power BI:** Created interactive dashboards and data visualizations to facilitate actionable insights.

- **DAX:** Developed KPIs and calculated fields for custom metrics, further refining insights.

## üßπ SQL Data Cleaning & Inspection

### 1. Removing Duplicates
Duplicates were removed from each dataset to maintain data integrity. Below are sample SQL queries used:

```sql
-- Remove duplicates in voter_registration data
WITH duplicates AS (
    SELECT ctid, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY voter_id ORDER BY voter_id) as rn
    FROM voter_registration 
)
DELETE FROM voter_registration 
WHERE ctid IN (SELECT ctid FROM duplicates WHERE rn > 1);
```
---

### 2. Handling Missing Values
Next, missing values were identified across tables to avoid incomplete analysis. For example:

```sql
-- Check for missing values in voter_registration table
SELECT 
    count(*) - count(voter_id) AS missing_voter_id,
    count(*) - count(name) AS missing_name,
    count(*) - count(age) AS missing_age,
    count(*) - count(gender) AS missing_gender,
    count(*) - count(address) AS missing_address,
    count(*) - count(voter_registration_date) AS missing_voter_registration_date
FROM voter_registration;
```

## üîç SQL-Based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Once cleaned, exploratory data analysis (EDA) in SQL uncovered insights related to voter demographics, security issues, and user engagement patterns.

### 1. Voter Demographics and Participation Insights
**A. Voting History and Engagement:** Analyzed voter turnout among first-time and returning voters.

```sql
-- Returning Voter turnout rate
SELECT 
    ROUND((SUM(CASE WHEN voting_history = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::Numeric / COUNT(*)) * 100, 2) AS voter_turnout_rate
FROM voter_registration;

```

**B. Age Distribution Analysis:** Revealed voter participation across age groups.

```sql
SELECT 
    CASE WHEN age < 18 THEN 'Under 18'
         WHEN age >=18 AND age < 25 THEN '18-24'
         WHEN age >=25 AND age < 35 THEN '25-34'
         WHEN age >=35 AND age < 50 THEN '35-49'
         WHEN age >=50 AND age < 65 THEN '50-64'
         WHEN age >= 65 THEN '65 and above'
         ELSE 'unknown' END AS Age_Group,
    COUNT(*) AS total_voters
FROM voter_registration
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY total_voters DESC;
```
---
### 2. Security Incident Insights
**A. Security Incident Frequency by Month:** Analyzed monthly incident counts to identify trends.

```sql
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM timestamp) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS incidents_count 
FROM security_logs
GROUP BY year, month
ORDER BY year, month;
```
**B. Most Common Event Types:** Identified common security issues to prioritize fixes.

```sql
-- Count of event types in security logs
SELECT 
   event_type,
   COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM security_logs
GROUP BY event_type
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```
---

### 3. User Experience Insights
**A. Device Usage Patterns:** Insights into which devices users preferred.

```sql
-- Voter engagement by device type
SELECT 
    user_device AS device, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_interactions 
FROM user_interaction
GROUP BY device
ORDER BY total_interactions DESC;
```

**B. Drop-off Rate Analysis:** Tracked where users exited during the voting process.

```sql
SELECT
       SUM(CASE WHEN Page_Views >= 1 AND page_views <= 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Landing_Page,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Page_Views > 5 AND page_views <= 10 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS View_Election_Info,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Page_Views > 10 AND page_views <= 15 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Start_Voting_Process,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Page_Views > 15 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Complete_Vote
FROM User_Interaction;

## üìà Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Using DAX, KPIs were created to monitor platform performance, such as Returning Voter Rate, First-Time Voter Rate, Security Breach Rate, and User Drop-Off Rate.

**Example KPIs:**

Returning Voter Turnout Rate
```dax
ReturningVoters = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Voter_Registration), Voter_Registration[Voting_History] = TRUE)
Security Breach Rate
```

```dax
SecurityBreachRate = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('security_logs'), 'security_logs'[event_type] = "Security Breach"),
    COUNTROWS('security_logs')
)
```
